# ERC20 Token with Tax and Anti-Bot Mechanism

This smart contract implements an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain with advanced features such as transaction fees (tax) and an anti-bot mechanism, designed to enhance the security and functionality of the token.

## Key Features:

### Transaction Fees (Tax):
- A tax is applied on both buy and sell transactions. The buy and sell fees are configurable by the contract owner and can be set as percentages of the transaction value.
- Collected fees are transferred to a designated `feeReceiver` address, which can be used for liquidity, marketing, or other project-related activities.

### Anti-Bot Mechanism:
- To prevent market manipulation by bots, the contract enforces a limit on the number of sells allowed per block. This feature is particularly useful in the early stages of a tokenâ€™s launch to prevent price volatility.
- A `maxWalletSize` is imposed during the buy process to limit the number of tokens any individual wallet can hold, reducing the risk of whales or bots accumulating large amounts of tokens quickly.
- The anti-bot mechanism also includes a cooldown period between transactions and the ability to restrict trading until the liquidity pool is created.

### Uniswap Integration:
- The contract is integrated with the Uniswap V2 router, allowing the owner to add liquidity directly through the contract.
- The `startTrading()` function enables the liquidity pool and activates trading once the required liquidity is added. This ensures a smooth token launch process.

### Ownership Controls:
- The contract is designed to be highly configurable by the owner. Ownership privileges include:
  - Setting or adjusting buy and sell fees.
  - Removing limits on transaction size and wallet holdings.
  - Updating contract settings like swap thresholds and liquidity parameters.
- The owner can renounce ownership once the configuration phase is complete, ensuring decentralization and reducing the risk of central authority control.

### Efficiency and Security:
- The contract uses Solidity's latest version (0.8.22), which provides optimized gas usage and enhanced security features like overflow protection.
- Internal safeguards prevent common issues like transferring from or to the zero address.

## Example Use Cases:
- **DeFi Projects**: This token can be used in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications where transaction fees are needed to fund liquidity or staking rewards.
- **Token Launches**: With the built-in anti-bot measures, this contract is ideal for new token launches to prevent botting and protect early investors.
- **Governance**: The flexible fee system and ownership controls make this contract suitable for governance tokens in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).

## How to Deploy:

1. **Compile and Deploy**: You can deploy this contract using the Remix IDE or any other Ethereum-compatible environment.
2. **Add Liquidity**: Use the `startTrading()` function to add liquidity on Uniswap and activate trading.
3. **Configure Fees and Limits**: Customize the buy and sell fees, transaction limits, and wallet size restrictions through the provided functions.

This smart contract provides a secure, flexible, and robust foundation for any Ethereum-based project that requires an ERC-20 token with advanced features like transaction tax and bot prevention.
